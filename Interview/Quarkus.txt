What is Quarkus?
Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored specifically for cloud-native applications, microservices, and serverless architectures. It aims to optimize Java for low memory usage and fast startup times, which are critical in modern cloud environments, especially for containerized applications.

Key Features:
-Native Compilation: Quarkus can compile Java applications into native machine code using GraalVM, resulting in extremely fast startup times and reduced memory footprint.
-Kubernetes Native: It has built-in support for Kubernetes, enabling seamless integration with cloud platforms and containers.
-Reactive Programming: Quarkus provides excellent support for reactive programming, offering both imperative and reactive styles.
-Developer Experience: It includes features like live coding, allowing developers to see changes in real-time without restarting the application.
-Microservices Friendly: With support for standards like MicroProfile, Quarkus is highly suited for building microservices.
-Unified Configuration: Quarkus provides a single configuration mechanism across all frameworks, making it easier to manage settings.
-Small Memory Footprint: It's optimized for minimal resource usage, which is ideal for environments like containers and serverless platforms.

How Does Quarkus Work?
Quarkus follows a container-first philosophy, meaning it is optimized for creating applications that work well in containers. Here's how it works:

Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT): Quarkus compiles most of the application's logic during build time (rather than runtime), reducing the load during the startup phase.
-GraalVM Native Image: Quarkus can compile applications into native executables with GraalVM. This dramatically improves startup time (down to milliseconds) and reduces memory usage, perfect for microservices and cloud deployments.
-Hot-reload (Live Coding): It supports live reload, allowing developers to make code changes and see the effect immediately without restarting the server.
-Supports Multiple Frameworks: It can integrate seamlessly with existing Java EE (Jakarta EE), Hibernate, RESTEasy, and others, while offering additional tools for optimizing them in a microservice-based architecture.
