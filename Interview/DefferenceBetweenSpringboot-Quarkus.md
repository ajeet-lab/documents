Here’s a comparison of Spring Boot and Quarkus in simple terms:
# Top 10 difference between springboot and quarkus

### 1. **Startup Time:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Takes more time to start, especially when dealing with large applications.
   - **Quarkus**: Designed for fast startup, ideal for cloud environments and serverless applications.

### 2. **Memory Usage:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Uses more memory because it loads a lot of components.
   - **Quarkus**: Uses less memory by only loading necessary components, making it lightweight.

### 3. **Native Compilation:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Can run on the JVM but doesn't natively compile applications.
   - **Quarkus**: Supports native compilation using GraalVM, allowing applications to run faster with smaller memory footprints.

### 4. **Cloud-Native:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Works well with cloud environments but wasn't initially designed with cloud-native features in mind.
   - **Quarkus**: Built from the ground up for cloud-native development, particularly suited for Kubernetes and serverless.

### 5. **Developer Experience:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Rich ecosystem and mature tools with comprehensive documentation and community support.
   - **Quarkus**: Provides a modern development experience with features like live reload, but has a smaller ecosystem since it’s newer.

### 6. **Dependency Injection:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Uses Spring's Dependency Injection mechanism, which is powerful but can be complex.
   - **Quarkus**: Uses a simplified dependency injection model (CDI - Contexts and Dependency Injection) that is lightweight and quicker.

### 7. **Build Time:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Longer build times because of the traditional Java framework design.
   - **Quarkus**: Faster build times due to its modern, optimized architecture.

### 8. **Extension and Plugin Ecosystem:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Has a vast number of plugins and libraries due to its long history in the Java ecosystem.
   - **Quarkus**: Offers a growing number of extensions, but the ecosystem is smaller compared to Spring Boot.

### 9. **Performance:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Good runtime performance but less efficient in memory and startup time.
   - **Quarkus**: Optimized for high performance with lower memory usage and faster response times, especially in cloud environments.

### 10. **Ease of Migration:**
   - **Spring Boot**: Mature with numerous tools for migrating legacy Java applications.
   - **Quarkus**: Supports migration but may require more effort if switching from Spring Boot because of different approaches to coding and configurations. 

In summary, **Spring Boot** is well-established with a mature ecosystem, while **Quarkus** is optimized for cloud-native and serverless environments with a focus on fast startup and low memory usage. The choice between the two depends on your application's requirements and infrastructure.
